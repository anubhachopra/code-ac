[Python] A public dataset on US non-profit regulations by integrating digitized US non-profit law text data with Urban Institute's Legal Compendium using Python libraries.

2. [Minimum Wage Laws and Labor Market Outcomes through a Gendered Lens](https://github.com/anubhachopra/code-ac/tree/17c8120d66226ab69851f6b7139e9d98db41311a/code-stata)
[Stata] This paper, through a gendered lens, extends the work of Dube et. al. (2016) on the impact of Minimum Wage Laws on employment stock, flows, and duration in the US labor market. Using a border discontinuity design, we draw five main conclusions. Increases in minimum wages (i) has disemployment effects for female workers at a national level (ii) positively impacts restaurant earnings, with a gender differential in favor of female earnings (iii) reduces separations and turnover rate among female workers (more pronounced in restaurant industry) (iv) positively impacts earnings for female movers (hires and separations) at both national and restaurant levels (v) has null effects on non-employment duration for all industrial and gender groups. Increased earnings, decreased turnover rates, and no impact on non-employment duration has positive implications for gender wage gap and female labor force (re)participation.
